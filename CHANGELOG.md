# Changelog

All notable changes to `ironcondor` are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog 1.1.0](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html)
(the full versioning policy lives in the design docs, local until v0.1.0).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Market-data types: `InstrumentSpec` (validated `> 0` tick size and
  contract multiplier — the single authoritative cents↔ticks / scaling
  source), `QuoteView` (per-contract unit Greeks in native `optionstratlib`
  bases, `Decimal` analytics as the documented exception), and
  `ChainSnapshot` with `BTreeMap` quotes so iteration order is part of the
  determinism contract (#4).
- Execution-record types: lifecycle ids (`PositionId`, `OrderId`,
  `TradeId`), `PositionAction`, `TimeInForce`, `OrderIntent`,
  `OrderCommand`, and the mode-agnostic `Fill` carrying
  `mode: ExecutionMode`; `ExecutionMode` moved to `domain::execution` (#4).
- The `sign_convention` helper module encoding the one truth table:
  `side_sign`, checked `slippage_cents` (positive = adverse, both sides
  tested), and `spread_capture_cents = −Σ slippage` — the single sign flip
  (#4).
- Exact hand-written `Ord` on `ContractKey` (consistent with its exact
  `Eq`/`Hash`) so `BTreeMap` snapshot ordering is deterministic (#4).

- Canonical domain newtypes: `Cents` (signed ledger money, checked
  arithmetic returning `ArithmeticOverflow` — never a silent wrap),
  `PriceCents` with the two `Decimal` boundary helpers (banker's rounding on
  the `Decimal → cents` edge only, lossless reverse), `Quantity` (strictly
  positive), `Ticks`, `SimTime`, `StepIndex` — all `#[serde(transparent)]`
  bare scalars (#3).
- Contract identity: `Underlying` (grammar `^[A-Z0-9._]{1,32}$`),
  `ContractKey` reusing the upstream `ExpirationDate`/`OptionStyle` with
  hand-written **exact** equality/hashing (documented divergence from the
  upstream epsilon-tolerant semantics), and the round-trippable versioned
  `contract_id` (`"v1:{UNDERLYING}:{expiration_ns}:{strike_cents}:{style}"`)
  (#3).
- Property-test suite (`tests/property.rs`): money serde round-trips,
  no-silent-overflow cents arithmetic, `contract_id` round-trip identity,
  deterministic dollar→cents conversion (#3).

- `BacktestError` (thiserror): the single typed error boundary — every
  documented kind from the domain model, with lowercase messages carrying the
  offending value; upstream errors convert into these kinds in `src/error.rs`
  and nowhere else (#2).
- `BacktestConfig` skeleton with `validate()` as the untrusted-config seam
  (positive capital, per-field `ResourceLimits` hard caps, non-negative
  slippage fraction, no directory-escaping output path), `ResourceLimits`
  with documented defaults and hard caps, `FeeSchedule`, `SlippageModel`,
  `ExecutionMode`, and a minimal `DataSourceSpec` (Csv/Parquet) — all
  `deny_unknown_fields`; money fields are integer cents, never `f64` (#2).

- Crate skeleton: the layered `src/` module tree (`domain`, `engine`,
  `execution`, `data`, `analytics`, `bundle`, `python`, `error`, `config`) as
  compiling placeholders, `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` + `#![warn(missing_docs)]`
  at the crate root, the four feature flags (`default`, `orderbook`,
  `simulator`, `python`), and the unconditional `rlib` + `cdylib` crate types
  (#1).
- Toolchain and lint policy: `rust-toolchain.toml` pinned to stable 1.97.0,
  `rustfmt.toml`, `clippy.toml`, and a root `Makefile` with the `pre-push`
  gate (#1).
- CI skeleton (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`): `fmt`, `clippy`, `test`, and
  `build-release` jobs on pinned runner and toolchain images with
  cancel-in-progress concurrency (#1).
- Design documentation for the planned backtester (`docs/`): PRD, roadmap,
  competitive analysis, domain model, engine architecture, data layer,
  execution models, analytics/reporting, Python bindings, and ADRs 0001–0006.

## [0.0.1] - 2026-07-12

### Added

- Name-reservation placeholder published to crates.io. No implementation code
  yet; `src/lib.rs` carries crate-level docs only. The roadmap begins at
  v0.1.0.
